### CPSC 120

* Lab 7:
This lab was one of my favorites because Iâ€™ve always loved playing card games like blackjack in my free time. The opportunity to code how cards are dealt with made the experience both exciting and highly enjoyable.

* Lab 11:
Although not my favorite, Lab 11 was incredibly rewarding. I loved working on the code for analyzing population differences across US states. Though it was kind of challenging and I failed that lab a couple of times, it turned out to be the one where I learned the most.

* Lab 9: 
Lab 9 was my absolute favorite for a few reasons. My group members were hilarious and great to work with, which made the experience. On top of that, I had a lot of fun coding the secret number game. It was simpler than some other labs, but its simplicity made it even more enjoyable.
